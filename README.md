# Tensor Operations using TensorFlow and PyTorch

### Tensor Operations using PyTorch
This notebook demonstrates a wide range of tensor operations using PyTorch, including:

Tensor Basics: Creation of scalars, vectors, matrices, 3D tensors; shape and dtype introspection.

Visualization: Tensor slices and image representations using matplotlib.

Einops Utilities: rearrange, reduce, and repeat for expressive tensor reshaping and channel manipulation.

Advanced Indexing: scatter, as_strided(), torch.where() for memory-efficient views and conditional selection.

Custom Operations:

Custom activation function (Swish)

Broadcasting visualization (sin(x² + y²))

In-place operations, slicing, and reshaping (view, reshape, squeeze, unsqueeze)

Linear Algebra:

SVD, QR, Cholesky decomposition

Eigen decomposition and visualization

Autograd: Gradient computation with .backward() and custom autograd functions.

Image Processing: Patch extraction using unfold()

Memory Management: storage() checks for shared memory

Sparse Tensors: Efficient tensor creation using COO format

Performance Tools: torch.vmap() for efficient batch operations

Fourier Transform: FFT on complex tensors

Random Sampling: Normal and multinomial sampling
